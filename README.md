# snippet

Code snippet manager that allows you to save, search, organize, and reuse small pieces of code. Improves productivity by quickly retrieving commonly used code patterns and integrating them into your workflow.

## Key features

1. Storage of Code Snippets
   1. Store snippets in a structured way (e.g., a local file system, SQLite database)
   2. Allow for various file types: Ruby, Bash, Go, Rust, etc.
   3. Snippets can be small utility functions, commonly used configurations, API call examples, SQL queries, etc.
2. Tagging and Categorizations
   1. Each snippet can have tags (e.g., `ruby`, `api`, `performance`, `regex`, `database`) to make them easily searchable
   2. Categorize snippets by language, framework, or functionality (e.g., "Database Queries", "API Requests", "Authentication").
3. Search Functionality
   1. Fast, keyword-based search to find snippets based on their content, titles, or tags.
   2. Option to search by language or framework.
   3. Fuzzy search or autocomplete to speed up searching (In-progress).

### Future Integrations

1. Syntax highlighting
   1. When viewing snippets, show syntax highlighting for different languages (Ruby, Python, HTML, etc.). Ensures the code looks readable and well-organized when browsing or editing snippets.
2. CLI and Editor Integration
3. Snippet sharing
   1. Export snippets as JSON, YAML, or plain text for sharing across teams or machines.
   2. Option to import snippet collections from shared repositories.
4. Snippet history and versioning
   1. Maintain a history of snippet edits or versions, allowing you to track changes and rollback to previous versions if necessary.
5. Snippet syncing
   1. Optional sync snippets across multiple devices used cloud services.
6. User authentication (for multi-user use case)
